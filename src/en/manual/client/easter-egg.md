Although versions 1.6, 2.5, 2.8, 3.8, and 4.8 have passed, the limited time map will exist as an Easter egg in the map.

Both the webpage and client can display/hide time limited areas by entering mysterious codes.

Enter the following mysterious code to display a limited time area map:

[[arrUp]][[arrUp]][[arrDown]][[arrDown]][[arrLeft]][[arrRight]][[arrLeft]][[arrRight]][[B]][[A]][[B]][[A]]

Enter the reverse mysterious code to close the Easter egg~

[[arrDown]][[arrDown]][[arrUp]][[arrUp]][[arrRight]][[arrLeft]][[arrRight]][[arrLeft]][[A]][[B]][[A]][[B]]
